// Fetching another channel for a turn: the pulled block (`<channel_view>`).
// A turn sometimes needs a channel other than the one it speaks in -- the
// read-only channel a call came from, a channel someone named with an
// explicit <#id>, or any channel a route hook names -- and without it the
// persona would be asked about a channel it cannot see. The pure decisions
// live elsewhere: src/behavior/pull.js (the window that ends at the channel's
// newest message, the pictures that may get a caption, the `context.pull`
// settings) and src/behavior/elsewhere.js (the ring of calls, the audience
// comparison). This module is the Discord side, fetchPull, which any caller
// can use for any channel id: the rails a pull must pass (a readable text
// channel, allowed, not a thread, not the dry-run mirror, visible to everyone
// who can view the channel the persona speaks in), one page of history, the
// ring's calls marked on their lines, and the captions -- the cache's first,
// fresh ones only for a turn certain to run, in parallel and never waited
// for past a timeout. A pull made before the turn is certain (a chooser can
// still return `not-now`) gets its fresh captions later from captionPulled,
// without fetching the channel again.
