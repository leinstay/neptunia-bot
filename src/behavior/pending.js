// Pure queue of "pending" calls: a @mention, a reply or the persona's name
// that arrived while a turn was running in its own channel
// (config.mention.pendingSameChannel) or, with one attention
// (config.mention.oneAtATime), somewhere else; a private message waiting for
// the same reason; a follow-up the address classifier said `yes` to, the
// same way; a call from a channel the persona cannot write in, routed
// to the main channel (its `destination`), whose turn found the attention
// taken. Every call waits for its own answer: the queue keeps them all in
// arrival order, several per channel and per author, and a newer call never
// takes an older one's place (a deferred follow-up excepted: one per channel,
// replaced in src/discord/events.js). At most mention.maxPending entries overall; the
// single oldest entry, of any channel, is evicted when full. A routed call
// keeps the calls its settle wait grouped with it (`superseded`), so whatever
// ends it -- the ignore roll letting it pass -- ends those too. A later message
// of an author about one of their waiting calls is folded into it (`added`)
// instead of waiting as a call of its own: the decision is the merge
// classifier's (src/discord/events.js), parsed here (parseMergeAnswer).
// In-memory only, never persisted -- a restart forgetting every pending call
// is fine.
//
// The orchestration (when to enqueue, when and how to drain the queue once a
// turn finishes, the actual ignore decision, the merge request) lives in
// src/discord/events.js; this module only knows about the list itself.
