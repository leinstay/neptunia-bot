// "Elsewhere": the persona may read a channel it cannot write in (a diary, an
// announcements channel), and a call or something worth a remark there has
// nowhere to go. This module is the pure core of answering or commenting in
// the main channel instead (the destination, the first usable id of
// `memory.mainChannelIds`): when a settle wait in the source is due, the ring
// of calls received there (answered, skipped by choice, or still unanswered),
// the per-channel seen mark that keeps the persona from commenting twice on
// the same content, the ordinary liveness rule a noticed comment found on a
// tick must pass (a count the writable channels' chooser can share), the
// audience comparison that keeps a narrower channel's content out of a wider
// one, the destination pick and the jump link of a message.
//
// No I/O, no discord.js: the clock is passed in, Discord objects are read by
// the callers and handed over as plain values (ids, timestamps, sets of ids,
// a usability check). Every function returns new values and never mutates
// its input, so the stored shapes (`state.json` `elsewherePings`,
// `elsewhereSeen`) only change where the caller assigns the result and marks
// the state dirty.
