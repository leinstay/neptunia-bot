// pass it, each with a budget or a trigger of its own, so none of them can
// burn through the day's request cap of the chat:
// - the memory warmup (src/memory/warmup.js), a long-running seeding job
//   under its own token budget (`warmup.maxTokens`);
// - the mentor's judge (src/mentor/mentor.js) and the mentor sandbox
//   (src/mentor/sandbox.js), both under the mentor's daily token budget
//   (`mentor.maxTokensPerDay`);
// - `/nep ping` (src/admin.js), a 16-token request per model route, sent on
//   the owner's command only.
// Every other request counts: the reply and every helper before it, the
// analyzer, the voice model, a portrait refresh. The per-request token cap

   * usage reports none -- the count a caller's own token budget should add up, since a raw
   * `usage.prompt_tokens` may leave the cached part out (`llm.cache.promptIncludesCached` false).
   * `finishReason` is the provider's `choices[0].finish_reason` verbatim
   * (e.g. `'stop'`, `'length'`), or `undefined` when the provider omitted it —
   * callers use it to tell a cut-off completion (`'length'`) from a genuinely
   * bad answer. `provider` is OpenRouter's name for the upstream provider that
   * served the request (`json.provider`), or `undefined` when the response omits it.
   * `options.model` / `options.maxOutputTokens` / `options.temperature`
   * override the config defaults (`llm.model`, `llm.maxOutputTokens`, `llm.temperature`).
   *
   * Retries (`llm.retries`): a network failure, a timed-out attempt and an
   * HTTP status in `RETRY_STATUS` are retried after `backoffMs`, each retried
   * attempt logged as `llm: retry` (`attempt` 1-based, `status` or null,
   * `name`, plus `limitSource` / `provider` when the error body is JSON naming
   * them in `error.metadata`, and `kind` when `providerLimitOf` finds one); the
   * last one is thrown. One exception: a 429 whose body names the provider
   * account's quota of the day (kind `daily`) is thrown after that one attempt
   * (same `statusCode`, `body` and message) and logged once as
   * `llm: provider limit` (role, model, status, limitSource, provider, kind,
   * `retried: false`; codes only, never the provider's text). Once a 200 was received
   * (the request may be billed) nothing is retried: a `json.error` body or an
   * unparsable body is thrown as it is, and so is an error the provider put
   * in the first choice (`choices[0].error`, or `finish_reason: 'error'`):
   * an Error with the provider's message, its numeric code on `statusCode`,
   * `errorType` (`error.metadata.error_type`) and `nativeFinishReason`,
   * logged once as `llm: provider error` (role, purpose, model, status,
   * errorType, nativeFinishReason, ms) with no `llm: usage` line.
   * Every other answered request logs one `llm: usage` line (role, purpose, origin,
   * model, provider, token counts, the prompt cache's `cache` code -- `read` |
   * `write` | `none`, or `off` when no marker was sent --, cost, BYOK flag,
   * response id, and `ms`, the time from the start of the first attempt to the
   * answer; null where the response or the caller omits a value), whatever its
   * role -- see `usageLogFields`.
   * Hedged calls (`llm.hedge`, see `hedgeSettings`): a request carrying the
   * helper mark (`options.helper === true`, set by `helperRequestOptions` only;
   * never sent) whose `options.role` is listed in `llm.hedge.roles`, while
   * `llm.hedge.afterMs` is above 0, never enters the retry loop above: attempt 1
   * is sent; one answering before `afterMs` (a success or a non-retryable error)
   * is the result as ever; at `afterMs` -- or at once when attempt 1 fails first
   * with a retryable error -- attempt 2 is sent with the same body (logged once as
   * `llm: hedge` with role, purpose, model, afterMs) and the first success wins,
   * the other attempt aborted. A failure while the other attempt is out waits
   * for it; when both fail the most telling error is thrown (a rail refusal over
   * an error the provider answered with over a network failure or a timeout). At
   * `llm.hedge.timeoutMs` from the start (`llm.hedge.longTimeoutMs` for a set
   * marked `options.long === true`, also never sent) both are aborted and a
   * `TimeoutError` is thrown. A provider's quota of the day is thrown at once, as above. Rails: the
   * token cap is checked once; attempt 2 is counted against
   * `llm.maxRequestsPerDay` when it is sent and is never sent without room under
   * it. The winner's usage line adds `hedged` (whether attempt 2 was sent) and
   * `attempt` (1 or 2, the winner); `ms` still runs from attempt 1's start.
   * `options.timeoutMs` still cuts each attempt on its own.
   * `options.hedge` — an explicit hedge for this one call, `{ afterMs, timeoutMs }` (both finite
   * numbers above 0; never sent): any request carrying one is hedged as above, with attempt 2
   * at its `afterMs` and the whole call cut at its `timeoutMs`, whatever its role and with or
   * without the helper mark or an `llm.hedge` group; the rails, the counting of attempt 2 and
   * the cache marker (the same body twice) are as above. Anything else leaves the helper rule
   * in charge. Exists for the reply of a turn with a bar (`pace.replyHedgeMs`): a provider stall
   * must not let a direct call pass its bar unanswered.
   * `options.purpose` — what the request is for, a kebab-case code (`reply`,
   * `memory-voice`, `address`, `rewatch`, `lookup`, `read-link`,
   * `search-summary`, `describe`, ...): the requests that share one role are told
   * apart by it in the journal (the reply and the memory wording both go out as
   * role `voice`).
   * `options.origin` — where the request comes from when it is not live chat
   * traffic (e.g. `mentor`), so a day's count can leave it out. Both are
   * logged on the usage line only: never sent in the request body, never
   * used for routing.
   * The calibrator is fed, and the over-cap warning
   * (`llm: provider counted more prompt tokens than the cap`) compares, the
   * provider's count of the whole prompt, its cached part included
   * (`promptTokens` above: `fullPromptTokens`, by `llm.cache.promptIncludesCached`
   * for a marked request).
   * `options.cache` — the prompt-cache marker for this one call: `true` forces
   * it (whatever the model), `false` forbids it, anything else leaves the policy
   * in charge (a marker only while `features.promptCache` is true, `options.role`
   * is listed in `llm.cache.roles` and the request's model starts with a prefix
   * listed in `llm.cache.models`; see `cacheTtlFor`). The memory wording passes
   * `false` (`MEMORY_VOICE_REQUEST`): it shares the reply's role `voice`, not its
   * system text, so only the reply is marked. The marker (TTL
   * `llm.cache.ttl`) is placed on the system message by `withCacheMarker` after
   * the estimate and the token cap check, which always see the caller's
   * `messages` as given.
   * `options.timeoutMs` overrides `llm.timeoutMs` for the request's abort
   * signal — the analyzer (a large batch, a long JSON answer) and the media
   * describer need more room than a chat reply's default.
   * `options.countAgainstDailyCap` (default true) — `false` skips the daily
   * request counter and is never refused by it: passed by the memory warmup,
   * the mentor's judge, the mentor sandbox and `/nep ping` only (see the
   * header comment for why each is exempt).
   * `options.maxRequestTokens` — overrides `cfg.maxRequestTokens` for this one call's pre-flight
   * cap check only (the global rail stays in force for every caller that omits it). Exists for
   * the memory warmup (src/memory/warmup.js), whose requests are fitted under a much larger,
   * separately-budgeted cap (`warmup.maxRequestTokens`) than a live chat/analyzer request.
   * `options.skipCalibration` (default false) — never feeds the provider's prompt
   * count into the calibrator. For every request whose provider-counted prompt
   * tokens say nothing about the text ratio the other requests are checked
   * against: a 16-token `/nep ping`, a picture or video describe (the vision
   * model counts media its own way), the short classifier passes.
   * `options.signal` — an external `AbortSignal` (e.g. an `AbortController`'s)
   * that cancels the in-flight HTTP request the moment it aborts, on top of
   * the per-attempt timeout signal (`options.timeoutMs`/`cfg.timeoutMs`) —
   * both combined with `AbortSignal.any`. Once `options.signal` is aborted,
   * a caught error is rethrown immediately with NO retry (an external abort
   * is deliberate, not a transient failure worth retrying). Exists for the
   * memory warmup's `/nep warmup stop` (src/memory/warmup.js): the
   * request already counted by the provider cannot be un-billed, but no
   * further retry/tokens are spent past the moment of the abort.
   * `options.provider` — OpenRouter provider routing for this one call; a plain
   * object REPLACES the configured routing (`llm.providerByModel`, then
   * `llm.provider`; see `resolveProvider`); any other value leaves the
   * configured routing in charge. Exists for the video describer, which pins
   * the provider that can fetch a public video URL.
   * `options.role` — which subprocess makes the request (`voice`, `analyzer`,
   * `classifier.text`, `classifier.media`, `classifier.video`, `mentor`; the
   * names of `/nep model`), so a `"<prefix>@<role>"` key of
   * `llm.providerByModel` can route it; never sent. A call without a role
   * matches only role-less keys.
   * `options.reasoning` — OpenRouter's reasoning settings for this one call
   * (e.g. `{ enabled: false }`); a plain object is sent verbatim as
   * `body.reasoning`, anything else omits the field. Used by the video
   * describer (`media.video.reasoning`), whose model otherwise spends the
   * output budget on reasoning, and by the two-stage analyzer's stage A and
   * the warmup's neutral route (`memory.reasoning`).
   * `options.videoSeconds` — seconds of video the request carries. A finite,
   * non-negative value adds `ceil(videoSeconds * tokensPerSecond)` to the raw
   * estimate before calibration, because `estimateMessages` cannot size a
   * `video_url` part on its own; the token cap then applies to the sum.
   * `tokensPerSecond` is `options.videoTokensPerSecond` when that is a finite
   * positive number, else `media.video.tokensPerSecond` (`VIDEO_TOKENS_PER_SECOND_FALLBACK`,
   * 120 per second, when unset; the rate of a statically sampled clip). The override exists for
   * the video describer's public-URL requests in agentic processing, where the
   * provider does not count the video as prompt tokens and the per-second cost
   * is far lower (`media.video.directUrlTokensPerSecond`).
