// The mentor's sandbox. A sandbox run takes an invented chat excerpt (a
// "situation"; or a real moment of the chat stored with a case, replayed from
// its normalized messages), builds the request a real turn would build --
// live prompts, live config, live stored memory -- asks the model, parses the
// answer, and stops there: nothing reaches Discord and nothing is written to
// memory. It reproduces the reply path (src/behavior/prompt.js#buildRequest,
// src/behavior/turn.js) as the turn it was: a real moment keeps its mode and
// trigger kind (an overheard line, a follow-up, a name call, an unasked
// turn), the call it answered from a channel the persona cannot write in and
// the other channels it was shown (`<channel_view>`,
// src/mentor/anchor.js#pulledFromStored); an invented situation is a reply
// -- a mention unless it names another kind -- and is shown no other channel.
// The last hours (`<recent>`) are the view's recent lines of the channel the
// turn is in, as they stood at the turn's time.
// Every input of buildRequest is named here (`sandboxRequestInput`); the ones
// a sandbox turn leaves out on purpose are `SANDBOX_OMITS`, each with its
// reason, so a new input of the request builder cannot go missing unseen.
// Outside that request it never reproduces the address classifier (whether
// the persona answers at all), the analyzer prompts, or a private chat.
//
// Every read of prompts, config and memory goes through a `view` (see
// `liveView`), never through `hot` or the store directly, so a caller can hand
// in another view of the same shape (a real moment's, src/mentor/moment.js).
// The private layer is out of bounds: a view has no accessor for it and no
// private chat is ever built.
