// The memory limits in one home: the fallbacks of the analyzer's limit settings and the fixed
// lengths of the texts it writes. The table lived in src/memory/update.js with a copy in
// src/memory/voice.js, and the self-fact and in-joke lengths were literals; the copies agreed only
// because tests compared them, and a drift would cut one text at two limits. This module imports
// nothing, so every memory module can take its limits from here without an import cycle
// (update.js wires voice.js in, and voice.js builds on src/behavior/prompt.js). The episode,
// attitude and teacher rules have their own homes: src/memory/episodes.js (EPISODE_CHARS,
// episodeDate, isSameEpisode), src/memory/affinity.js (REASON_CHARS, deltaCapOf)
// and src/memory/mentions.js (teacherToken).

/**
 * Fallbacks of the memory limits, equal to config.json's own values -- used only when a
 * deployment's config is missing the key. Most are `memory.<key>`; the others are
 * `relationships.maxDeltaPerUpdate`, `relationships.historySize`, `relationships.textChars`
 * (`relationshipChars`) and `lore.textChars` (`loreTextChars`). Frozen: a caller reads it, never
 * moves a fallback for everyone.
