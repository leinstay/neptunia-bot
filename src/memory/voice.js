// The pure core of the two-stage analyzer (`features.memoryTwoStage`). Stage A, a reasoning model
// on `memory.model`, returns neutral decisions; every text that must read in the persona's own
// voice comes back from it as a short factual BRIEF instead. Stage B, the voice model
// (`memory.voiceModel`), words those briefs later, many per request. This module is everything
// between the two that needs no I/O:
//
//   splitDecision     a stage A answer -> its neutral part, stored at once (the attitude delta and
//                     the episode with an empty feeling included, so an outage of the voice model
//                     never freezes scores or hides moments), plus one voice item per brief
//   mergeIntoQueue    items into the guild's queue (a per-guild list the store persists, normalised
//                     on read by `normalizeQueue`): one relationship / patterns / starters item per target
//                     (briefs appended), one character item per member (the newer replaces), a
//                     lesson or self fact already queued not queued again, the rest appended; past
//                     `memory.voice.queueMax` the oldest non-character overflow
//   dueItems          what the next voice request carries (`memory.voice.maxItems`, oldest first,
//                     one audience per request)
//   buildVoiceRequest / parseVoiceAnswer   the stage B request, fitted to the input cap AND to
//                     what `memory.voice.maxOutputTokens` can answer, and its answer, by request id
//   applyVoiceItems   worded texts -> store writes (plain data), by item id
//   retryLater / expireItems / degradedApply   exponential back-off from `memory.voice.retryMinutes`
//                     up to `memory.voice.queueHours`; an item too old or left out of too many
//                     answers takes the degraded path -- except a `character` item, which is never
//                     expired, overflowed or dropped: it stays queued until it is worded
//
// A private batch (a DM, src/memory/update.js#analyzePrivate) is split the same way. Its items
// carry `layer: 'private'`: they never merge with a public item, never share a request with
// anything but the same member's private items (what was said in private never sits beside what
// is worded for the server), and their writes name the layer, so they land in that member's
// private layer only. The feature switches are read at the moment of use: an item of a kind
// switched off since it was queued (`features.relationships`, `features.episodes`) is never sent
// or written, only counted.
//
// Pure: no store, no network, no clock. `nowMs` is passed in, store reads come in as injected
// lookups (`nameOf`, `oldTextOf`, `hasMember`, `tokenize`, `isKnownId`), store writes go out as
// plain objects the caller runs. Every function returns new arrays and never mutates its input,
// so a caller can keep each queue change a synchronous read-modify-write. No model-facing prose:
// the system message is prompts/memory-voice.md, everything else is JSON keys and kind codes.
