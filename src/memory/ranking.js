// Shared ranking for stored interests/details (src/memory/interests.js,
// src/memory/details.js): how "alive" one atomic item still is, combining how
// often it was confirmed (`weight`) with how long ago it was last mentioned,
// so a frequent-and-recent item outranks an ancient heavy one and a newcomer
// can gather weight in the unseen tail instead of being evicted the moment it
// arrives -- see .claude/docs/prompt-contract.md, "More is stored than shown,
// and rank decays with age". Used by the storage-eviction code in
// interests.js/details.js, the `<existing_profiles>` view builder
// (src/memory/update.js) and the chat-facing renderer (src/behavior/prompt.js)
// and `/nep memory show` (src/admin.js) -- every place that decides what is
// shown or what survives an eviction goes through the SAME function, so the
// warm-up (old history) and the live bot agree on what matters.
