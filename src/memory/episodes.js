// Pure merge logic for a member's remembered episodes -- moments the persona
// recalls about the two of them, appended by the analyzer (never rewritten)
// and evicted by weight then age once the per-person cap is exceeded, the
// newest few (`memory.keepNewestEpisodes`) spared so a light moment of a busy
// member is not thrown out the moment it arrives. See
// docs/prompt-contract.md ("episodes" in "The analyzer") and
// src/memory/update.js#applyMemoryUpdate, which routes the model's
// `users.<id>.episodes` through this module via src/memory/store.js#addEpisodes.
// Plus the display order (`sortEpisodesForDisplay`, also behind the owner's
// view in src/admin.js) and the top-N choice for a member asked about
// (`topEpisodes`), both used by src/behavior/prompt.js.
//
// It is also the one home of the episode rules the two-stage analyzer
// (src/memory/voice.js#splitDecision) must apply exactly as the store does, so
// a feeling item's address equals the stored episode: the text limits
// (`EPISODE_CHARS`), the date rule (`episodeDate`, to store a date or, with
// no clock, to test one) and the duplicate rule
// (`isSameEpisode`). This module therefore stays a leaf toward voice.js and
// src/behavior/prompt.js: importing either would close an import cycle
// (prompt.js imports this module, voice.js imports prompt.js).
