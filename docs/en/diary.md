# Diary

The persona posts in one channel on its own, at random times, without anyone asking. The posts look like a personal feed: drawings of scenes from the persona's world, memes, reflections, retold news, curious facts, one-line moods. Before each post the persona reviews its own recent history and picks something it has not done yet. The owner points the diary at a channel and tunes the schedule and kinds through config.

## Setup

1. Create a channel on your server. The bot needs View Channel, Send Messages, Read Message History and Attach Files there.
2. Run `/nep diary set <channel>`. The command checks permissions, writes `diary.channelId` to `config.local.json` and fills the diary history from the persona's past posts in that channel (when the history is empty).
3. The diary starts posting on the next tick (every 30 seconds). The first post may take a few minutes, depending on when the next planned slot falls.

`/nep diary show` prints today's plan: the channel, the slots in `bot.timezone`, how many posts and pictures were used today, and how many past posts are in the history.

`/nep diary off` clears the channel. The history file stays, so re-enabling keeps the persona's memory of what it posted.

`/nep diary post [kind] [topic]` forces one post now, outside the plan. When a turn is running, the command waits up to `diary.forceWaitMs` (120000 ms, two minutes) for it to finish; if the wait runs out it answers `busy`. It still obeys the daily caps. An optional kind key (e.g. `selfPicture`, `thought`) overrides the planner's choice; an unknown kind is refused with the full list. An optional free-text topic steers the post toward that subject.

## Windows

Posting times are drawn from windows, each a range of hours in `bot.timezone` with a `[min, max]` post count. A window whose `to` is not after its `from` wraps past midnight. For each window the scheduler draws an integer between `min` and `max` and places that many slots at random times inside the window. Slots closer than `diary.minGapMinutes` (90) to each other are dropped, and while more than `diary.maxPerDay` (3) remain, one is dropped at random.

The four default windows, with all times in `bot.timezone`:

| Window | Hours | Posts |
|---|---|---|
| Morning | 07–11 | `[0, 0]` (off) |
| Day | 12–16 | `[0, 1]` |
| Evening | 18–01 | `[0, 2]` |
| Night | 01–05 | `[0, 1]` |

With `diary.quietDayChance` (0.3) the whole day gets no slots at all. A plan is created once per local day (the date in `bot.timezone`) and stored in `data/state.json`. A new local day replans; a restart keeps the existing plan.

A slot missed by more than `diary.slotGraceMinutes` (30) while the bot was down is dropped, not fired late in a burst. A slot blocked by a busy attention is retried on the next tick within the grace.

## What a post costs

Each diary post is two model requests:

1. A plan request on the `classifier.text` model: picks the kind, a one-line brief, whether to search, and whether to draw.
2. A compose request on the main model (`llm.model`) with the character card and the full set of memory blocks.

When the plan asks for a web search (only for `diary.searchKinds`, by default `news` and `facts`), a Brave search runs first and adds a third request (the condenser on `classifier.text`). The search counts against `web.maxPerDay`.

When the post includes a picture, the image model generates it at its own price. Diary pictures count against both `image.maxPerDay` and `diary.maxPicturesPerDay` (2).

Every model request in a diary post counts against `llm.maxRequestsPerDay`. With the defaults (1–3 posts a day, 2–3 requests each, up to 2 pictures), a day costs roughly 3–9 chat requests plus picture generation.

## Kinds and seeds

`diary.kinds` maps each kind key to a weight. The planner sees the weights and how many of the last `diary.historyPosts` posts used each kind, so it favours kinds that have been underused. A kind with weight 0 is never chosen. The keys and their defaults:

| Kind | Weight | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `selfPicture` | 3 | The persona in a scene, a new setting every time |
| `picture` | 2 | A drawing without the persona: a place, an animal, something about a person here |
| `meme` | 1 | A meme the persona drew |
| `thought` | 2 | A longer reflection, a review, an opinion |
| `people` | 2 | A post about one person on the server: what they did or said lately, how the persona feels about them |
| `news` | 2 | Something found on the internet that the server's people care about |
| `facts` | 1 | A curious fact, an iceberg entry, a conspiracy theory told as such |
| `status` | 3 | One short line: mood, a plan, boredom |

`diary.searchKinds` (default `["news", "facts"]`) are the kinds that may trigger a search. `diary.pictureKinds` (default `["selfPicture", "picture", "meme"]`) always get a picture when the day's picture caps allow it, whatever the planner answered. Other kinds draw only when the planner asks for one. When a post cannot carry a picture (the day's picture caps are spent, drawing is off, no image model, or the bot lacks Attach Files in the diary channel), the planner sees only the text kinds. Forcing a picture kind with `/nep diary post` is refused before any request: the reply names the cap and its counts when a cap closed it, or says `pictures` for the other cases.

`prompts/diary-seeds.md` holds random seeds grouped by `# family` headers (place, setting, detail, activity, subject, twist). Code draws one line per family and composes `diary.seedSets` (2) combinations, handed to the planner in a `<seeds>` block. The combinations are near-infinite; the planner builds something absent from the diary history out of them, or ignores them when a better idea comes from the server's life.

To customise the seeds, copy `prompts/diary-seeds.md` to `prompts.local/diary-seeds.md` and edit the lines. Each line under a header is one seed; blank lines are ignored.

## The persona's world

`prompts/world.md` describes the persona's virtual world: the places and routines it lives in outside the chat. The tracked file is a neutral example. To write your own, create `prompts.local/world.md` (it replaces the tracked file whole, like `appearance.md`).

The world block appears only in the diary's two requests (plan and compose) and only when `diary.world` is `true` (default `false`). Turn it on with `/nep set diary.world true`. Without it, the persona has no fixed home and does not claim one.

The world file never appears in an ordinary chat turn. The scene text the persona writes in its `<draw>` tag carries what the image model needs to see.
